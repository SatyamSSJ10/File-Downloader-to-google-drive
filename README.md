# File-Downloader-to-google-drive

File Downloader to google drive; A google colab workflow to download files directly to your google drive

#Why fork this repo

I will update workflow in future so it is recommended to fork so that you'll get notified when there is a new version of file downloader or a new coomit

#How to Access it 

Download V1.1 Stable File downloader and upload it to google drive, then double-click to open it

<Note: This workflow is still in beta so can't gaurantee 100% results also there are still things which needs to be added (a better GUI, Torrent Downloader, Suggest me some moew in Discussion or issue)>
